# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# Lists are created using square brackets:

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

# List items can be of any data type:

list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]

# A list can contain different data types:

list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

# The list() Constructor    

thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)

# Python Collections (Arrays)   

# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# List
# Tuple
# Set
# Dictionary    

# When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type.
